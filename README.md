# Car_Price_Prediction

## **Description:**

* **Car price prediction is a common application of machine learning. The goal is to predict the price of a car based on a set of features, such as the make, model, year, mileage, and condition.**

* There are a number of different machine learning algorithms that can be used for car price prediction. Some of the most common algorithms include:

* **Linear regression:** Linear regression is a simple but effective algorithm that can be used to predict a continuous value, such as the price of a car.
Logistic regression: Logistic regression is a more complex algorithm that can be used to predict a binary value, such as whether a car will be sold or not.
* **Decision trees:** Decision trees are a powerful algorithm that can be used to predict a value based on a set of rules.
* **Random forests:** Random forests are a type of ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy of predictions.
The best algorithm for car price prediction will depend on the specific data set that is being used. In general, linear regression is a good starting point, but more complex algorithms may be necessary if the data set is large or complex.

* **Once an algorithm has been chosen, the next step is to train the model on a set of data. The training data should include features that are relevant to the price of the car, such as the make, model, year, mileage, and condition.**

* Once the model has been trained, it can be used to predict the price of new cars. The accuracy of the predictions will depend on the quality of the training data.

* Here are the steps involved in car price prediction using machine learning:

1. Collect data on cars, including features such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition.
2. Split the data into a training set and a test set.
3. Train a machine learning model on the training set.
4. Use the model to predict the prices of the cars in the test set.
5. Evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.
6. Use the model to predict the prices of new cars.


# Datasets Information
### Here are the explanations of the features in the car dataset:

* **Car_Name:** The name of the car.
* **Year:** The year the car was manufactured.
* **Selling_Price:** The price at which the car is being sold.
* **Present_Price:** The current market value of the car.
* **Kms_Driven:** The number of kilometers the car has been driven.
* **Fuel_Type:** The type of fuel the car uses.
* **Seller_Type:** The type of seller, such as a private individual or a car dealer.
* **Transmission:** The type of transmission the car has, such as manual or automatic.
* **Owner:** The number of previous owners the car has had.
